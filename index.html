          The Nigerian Egusi soup, prepared with

          >
          is the most loved soup for Nigerian Fufu meals in Nigeria. Foreigners
          love it because it is our soup that looks, feels and tastes most like
          a foreign sauce. Unfortunately there are those of us who do not like
          Egusi Soup for several different reasons. For some people it is the
          way the soup looks, for some it is because it gives them heartburn and
          for some it is because of the way it tastes. It is the
          <u>sweetest</u> of all Nigerian soups for swallows and those that do
          not have a sweet tooth do not like it because of that taste. On this
          page, I will share how I prepare Egusi Soup so that you can enjoy it.
          This involves tweaking the usual recipe so please pay attention when
          reading this recipe and when watching the video below. I include lots
          of information in the notes about the ingredients section.<br />

      <h4>Notes on the ingredients</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>
          I usually add enough red palm oil to colour the soup without the oil
          floating in the soup. This should be yellow when done not red. See
          video below.
        </li>
        <li>
          I use Igbo-style washed and squeezed bitter leaves. The bitter leaves
          were slightly wilted in the sun then washed and squeezed several times
          till all the bitterness is gone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Habanero or Scotch bonnet pepper is atarodo, atarugu or ose oyibo.
        </li>
        <li>1 disc of Ogiri Okpei should be enough.</li>
        <li>I don't use chicken nor fresh fish when preparing Egusi Soup.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- this is the preping step  -->

    <section>
      <h4>Before you cook Egusi Soup</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Grind the egusi seeds and the ogiri okpei with a spice grinder.</li>
        <li>
          Cook the shaki, goat meat, ponmo and stockfish with the seasoning
          cubes till done. I usually cook these with my pressure cooker. See
          video below.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because Igbo-style washed bitter leaves usually have long strands, cut
          into smaller pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Grind the crayfish if not yet ground.</li>
        <li>Chop or pound the pepper.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <!-- cooking directions -->
    <section> 
      <h4>Cooking Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When the meat and stockfish are done, remove them from the stock
          (water used in cooking the meat and fish) and place in a different pot
          or plate. Debone the stockfish and break into medium pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decant the stock into a big enough pot. Add the ground crayfish and
          egusi to the stock and stir. If the stock from cooking your meat and
          fish is not enough to give you a medium consistency, add some water to
          get a medium consistency. See video below.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and start cooking on low to medium heat.</li>
        <li>
          Keep a close eye on it and once the egusi cakes, stir and add a little
          bit more water. watch it closely so that it does not burn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat step 4, adding only a small quantity of water at a time. After
          about 20 minutes, you will notice the clear egusi oil coming to the
          surface of the soup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add and bitter leaves and red palm oil, stir, cover and continue
          cooking for 10 more minutes, stirring it often. The soup should be
          yellow when ready. This shows that the red palm oil has completely
          integrated in the soup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the pepper then the cooked meat and fish. Stir and add salt only
          if necessary. Egusi Soup can get salty very easily.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and cook till it boils again then turn off the heat.</li>
